# React Native using Expo and Typescript

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app based on [Expo](https://expo.io), written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org). Hot reloading works, but hot module replacement does not. [The steps required to set up a React Native app to using TypeScript](https://github.com/janaagaard75/expo-and-typescript/wiki).

The type definitions for Expo are maintained at [expo-sdk-with-type-definitions](https://github.com/janaagaard75/expo-sdk-with-type-definitions). They still require a lot of work.

This app can be viewed using the Expo client for iOS and Android: <https://expo.io/@janaagaard75/expo-and-typescript>
