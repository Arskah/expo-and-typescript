# React Native using Expo and Typescript

Demo [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app using [Expo](https://expo.io), written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org).

The app can be viewed using the Expo client for iOS and Android: <https://expo.io/@janaagaard75/expo-and-typescript>

Hot reloading works, but hot module replacement does not.
